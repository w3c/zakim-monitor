TODO: Do nothing if Zakim isn't on the channel? I.e., check if Zakim
is actually present and watch for it joining an leaving.

TODO: Zakim may currently be ignoring the agenda ("zakim, ignore
agenda"), in which case we should not react to "agenda+" and "agenda N
=" either.

TODO: When Zakim says "agendum X taken up", that doesn't always mean
that the previously open item is removed. It is only removed if it was
opened more than a minute ago, according to Zakim's clock...

TODO: Support /invite to join a given channel and monitor more than
one channel at a time?

TODO: Ask Zakim for the current queues when joining a channel?

TODO: Instead of sorting the questions each time they are printed on
the terminal, keep them sorted? support_question() and
unsupport_question() could move the question up or down in a list of
indexes when it has more or fewer supporters than its neighbours in
the list.

TODO: Nicer output. Support graphical output as well as curses.
Interact with the output, e.g., to scroll to hidden text, stop the
program, or ask it to synchronize itself with Zakim by explicitly
sending it commands on IRC, such as "agenda?".
